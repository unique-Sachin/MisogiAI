## Sample Outputs / Test Report

| Image | Question | Model Answer |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| ![cat](screenshots/cat.jpeg) | What animal is in this image? | That's a cat. More specifically, it appears to be a white cat with orange/ginger markings on its head and tail. It's a domestic shorthair. |
| ![stop_sign](screenshots/stop_sign.jpg) | What does this sign mean? | That's a **stop sign**. It's a universally recognized traffic control device that means drivers must come to a complete stop before proceeding. They must yield the right-of-way to any pedestrians or vehicles already in the intersection or approaching it. |
| ![city](screenshots/city.jpg) | Describe the scene. | Here is a description of the scene in the image: The photo shows a sunny day outside a security office in a high-rise apartment complex.  The foreground is dominated by a low, off-white security office building with the words "Handed City Security Office" prominently displayed. The building has several windows with maroon-colored frames. A portion of a tree is visible on the left. The background features multiple tall, light-colored apartment buildings. They are modern in style, with numerous stories and uniformly sized windows.  A large white and red striped security boom barrier extends diagonally across the scene, angled from the upper right corner towards the security office. A circular “STOP” sign is affixed to it.  The sky is mostly clear and blue, with only a few small clouds. Green trees are visible at the base of the apartment buildings. A streetlight is also visible on the right. |
