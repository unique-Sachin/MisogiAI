# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Project Title
Intelligent Email Response System (IERS)

## 1. Summary
Build an automated email reply platform that retrieves company policies, FAQs, and response templates to craft accurate, context-aware responses to incoming emails. It integrates with Gmail (via MCP) and processes messages in batches with prompt-caching for speed and cost efficiency.

## 2. Goals & Success Metrics
| Goal | Metric |
|------|--------|
|Reduce manual email workload| ≥ 80 % of incoming queries auto-resolved|
|Accuracy of policy reference| ≥ 95 % correct policy citations (sample audits)|
|Average response latency| ≤ 30 s per email (batch avg.)|
|System uptime| ≥ 99.5 %|

## 3. Target Users
• Customer-support & HR teams handling recurring queries.  
• Employees seeking instant answers to policy-related questions.

## 4. Problem Statement
Manual email responses are slow, error-prone, and costly. Employees or customers often need rapid, policy-compliant answers. Existing tools lack deep policy retrieval and contextual reply generation.

## 5. Solution Overview
1. **Knowledge Base** – Store policies, FAQs, and response templates.  
2. **Semantic Search** – Embed documents using language models; search vector index for relevant snippets.  
3. **Prompt Builder** – Combine email content, retrieved snippets, and templates into a prompt.  
4. **LLM Response Generator** – Use an LLM to draft replies.  
5. **Gmail Integration (MCP)** – Fetch unread emails in batches; send generated replies.  
6. **Caching Layer** – Cache frequently retrieved policies and prompts.  
7. **Batch Orchestrator** – Cron/queue-based job coordinating fetch → process → send.

## 7. Tech Stack
| Layer | Technology | Rationale |
|-------|------------|-----------|
|Language & Runtime| **Python 3.11** | Mature ecosystem, strong AI libraries |
|Web API / Worker| **FastAPI** | Async, lightweight, OpenAPI docs |
|Embeddings & Search| **SentenceTransformers**, **FAISS** | Local vector search, no vendor lock-in |
|LLM Interface| **OpenAI GPT-4o** (or company-hosted model) via SDK | High-quality generation |
|Caching| **Redis** | In-memory, supports TTL & LRU |
|Persistent Store| **PostgreSQL (pgvector)** | Store policies, embeddings, metadata |
|Email Integration| **Gmail MCP** | Secure, first-party Gmail access |


## 8. Functional Requirements
1. Ingest and version company policies, FAQs, and templates.  
2. Retrieve unread emails via Gmail MCP in configurable batch sizes.  
3. Perform semantic search to fetch top-k relevant snippets.  
4. Construct prompts and generate responses.  
5. Apply templates for consistent tone and branding.  
6. Send replies and mark emails as processed.  
7. Log interactions for audit & analytics.  
8. Cache hot policies/prompts for faster reuse.

## 9. Non-Functional Requirements
• Security: OAuth2 scopes limited to read/write Gmail; encrypt stored data at rest.  
• Scalability: Handle ≥ 10 k emails/day.  
• Observability: Structured logging, Prometheus metrics, alerting.  
• Compliance: GDPR—delete PII on request; maintain audit trails.  
• Availability: Degrade gracefully if LLM/API is down (queue & retry).

## 10. Assumptions
• Policies are provided in machine-readable formats (PDF, DOCX, Markdown).  
• Company permits storing embeddings externally if using third-party vector DB.  
• LLM usage costs are acceptable within budget.

## 11. Out-of-Scope
• Multi-language support (phase-2).  
• Voice or chat integrations.  
• Real-time (<1 s) responses.

## 12. Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|-----------|
|LLM hallucinations|Med|High|Reinforce prompts with citations; human review threshold|
|Policy updates not reflected|Med|Med|Automated nightly re-embedding job|
|Gmail API quotas|Low|High|Batch efficiently; exponential back-off|
