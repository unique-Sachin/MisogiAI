# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server for Discord Integration

---

## 1. Objective

Develop an MCP server that allows AI models to interact with Discord through a secured, structured interface. This server will serve as a middle layer between Discord bots and AI model clients. It must support real-time inspection, granular access control, and strict adherence to Discord API policies.

---

## 2. Features

### 2.1 Core MCP Server Capabilities

The MCP server must expose the following Discord-related operations via an HTTP API:

- **send_message**: Send a message to a specified Discord channel.
- **get_messages**: Fetch recent messages from a channel.
- **get_channel_info**: Retrieve metadata about a Discord channel.
- **search_messages**: Search message history using filters (e.g., user ID, date, keyword).
- **moderate_content**: Delete messages and manage user roles.

All endpoints must support:
- API Key authentication
- Permission checking
- Audit logging

---

### 2.2 Authentication & Permissions

Implement a robust security layer with the following capabilities:

- **API Key Authentication**: Clients must authenticate using an API key included in the request headers.
- **Permission System**: Role-based access control (RBAC) with per-key scope (e.g., read-only, write, admin).
- **Multi-Tenancy Support**: Isolate operations and data for different bots or organizations.
- **Audit Logging**: All API interactions must be logged with timestamp, key ID, endpoint, and result.

---

### 2.3 MCP Inspector Integration

Enable debugging and real-time monitoring using MCP Inspector:

- Log every request and response
- Enable real-time connection tracking via WebSocket
- Display ongoing operations and errors in the inspector dashboard

---

### 2.4 Security & Testing

- **Secrets Management**: All sensitive credentials (API keys, bot tokens) must be managed using environment variables.
- **Input Validation**: Validate all API inputs using strict schema definitions.
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse by implementing global and per-endpoint limits.
- **Unit Testing**: >80% test coverage using a standardized test suite.
- **Discord API Compliance**: Respect Discord rate limits, terms of service, and API constraints.

---

## 3. Tech Stack

### 3.1 Programming Language
- **Python 3.11+**

### 3.2 Backend Framework
- **FastAPI** — high-performance web framework with built-in data validation and auto-generated docs.

### 3.3 Discord Bot Integration
- **discord.py** — for building and managing the Discord bot, interacting with the Discord Gateway and REST API.

### 3.4 Database
- **PostgreSQL** — relational DB for storing tenants, API keys, audit logs, and bot data.

### 3.5 ORM
- **SQLAlchemy** — object-relational mapper used with PostgreSQL.

### 3.6 Testing
- **pytest** — for unit and integration tests.
- **coverage.py** — for enforcing 80%+ code coverage.

### 3.7 Rate Limiting
- **slowapi** — FastAPI-compatible rate limiter.

### 3.8 Input Validation
- **Pydantic** — schema validation and parsing.

### 3.9 Secrets Management
- **python-dotenv** — for loading environment variables from a `.env` file.

### 3.10 Logging
- **loguru** — for structured and readable logging.
- **Custom audit logger** — for tracking and persisting all operations.

### 3.11 Real-Time Inspection
- **WebSockets (FastAPI built-in)** — for pushing logs and connection updates to the MCP Inspector.

## 4. Deliverables

- Complete MCP server codebase
- API documentation (auto-generated by FastAPI)
- Working Discord bot
- `.env.example` file with all required environment variables
- Unit test suite with 80%+ coverage
- README with setup instructions
- MCP Inspector WebSocket feed and dashboard connection
- Postman collection for endpoint testing

---

## 5. Timeline (Suggested)

| Week | Tasks |
|------|-------|
| 1    | Project scaffolding, Discord bot setup, API design |
| 2    | Implement core MCP endpoints (`send_message`, `get_messages`, etc.) |
| 3    | Add authentication, permissions, audit logging |
| 4    | Integrate MCP Inspector, WebSocket updates |
| 5    | Security hardening, rate limiting, environment setup |
| 6    | Write tests, achieve 80% coverage, polish & finalize |

---

## 6. Success Criteria

- MCP server can reliably interact with Discord via defined endpoints.
- All access is authenticated and audited.
- >80% test coverage confirmed with reports.
- Real-time debugging through MCP Inspector is functional.
- System respects Discord's rate limits and security guidelines.
