# Scenario Analysis and Recommendations

This document analyzes three common LLM use cases using the Inference Calculator. For each scenario, we compare different model and hardware combinations (assuming a cloud deployment) and provide a recommendation for the optimal setup.

## Scenario 1: Real-Time Chatbot

A user-facing chatbot must have very low latency to feel responsive and interactive. Cost is also a major consideration due to the high volume of expected requests.

**Input Parameters:**
*   **Tokens:** 50
*   **Batch Size:** 1
*   **Primary Goal:** Lowest per-request latency.

### Analysis:

| Model | Hardware | Per-Request Latency | Memory Usage | Cost per Request | Compatible |
| :---- | :------- | :------------------ | :----------- | :--------------- | :--------- |
| 7B    | T4       | 0.037s              | 14.00 GB     | $0.00000555      | Yes        |
| 7B    | A100     | **0.014s**          | 14.00 GB     | $0.00001250      | Yes        |
| 13B   | T4       | 0.069s              | 26.00 GB     | $0.00001040      | **No**     |
| 13B   | A100     | 0.018s              | 26.00 GB     | $0.00001660      | Yes        |

### Recommendation: **7B Model on T4 GPU**

While the **7B on A100** provides the absolute lowest latency, the **7B on T4** is the clear winner for cost-effectiveness. Its latency of ~37ms is imperceptible to a human user and more than sufficient for a real-time experience. It costs less than half as much as the A100 setup per request, making it the most practical and scalable choice. The 13B model is not compatible with the T4's memory and offers no significant latency benefit on the A100 to justify its higher cost for this use case.

## Scenario 2: Document Summarizer

This use case involves processing longer documents. Latency is less critical than for a chatbot, but a reasonable response time is still expected. The quality of the summary is important, so a more capable model might be preferred.

**Input Parameters:**
*   **Tokens:** 1000
*   **Batch Size:** 2
*   **Primary Goal:** Balance between response time, quality, and cost.

### Analysis:

| Model | Hardware | Per-Request Latency | Memory Usage | Cost per Request | Compatible |
| :---- | :------- | :------------------ | :----------- | :--------------- | :--------- |
| 7B    | T4       | 0.733s              | 14.03 GB     | $0.0001110       | Yes        |
| 7B    | A100     | 0.275s              | 14.03 GB     | $0.0002500       | Yes        |
| 13B   | T4       | 1.375s              | 26.04 GB     | $0.0002080       | **No**     |
| 13B   | A100     | **0.366s**          | 26.04 GB     | $0.0003330       | Yes        |

### Recommendation: **13B Model on A100 GPU**

For summarization, the quality of the output is a key factor, and a 13B model generally provides more coherent and contextually aware summaries than a 7B model. The **13B on A100** offers a sub-second response time (~0.37s), which is excellent for this task. Although it's the most expensive option, the significant jump in model capability justifies the cost for a use case where quality is paramount. If budget is the primary constraint, the **7B on A100** is a viable alternative with slightly faster but potentially lower-quality output.

## Scenario 3: Batch QA System

In this scenario, a large number of questions are processed offline in a batch. The main goals are to maximize throughput (process as many questions as possible) and minimize the overall cost. Per-request latency is not a primary concern.

**Input Parameters:**
*   **Tokens:** 500
*   **Batch Size:** 10
*   **Primary Goal:** Lowest cost per request.

### Analysis:

| Model | Hardware | Per-Request Latency | Memory Usage | Cost per Request | Compatible |
| :---- | :------- | :------------------ | :----------- | :--------------- | :--------- |
| 7B    | T4       | 0.366s              | 14.07 GB     | **$0.0000555**   | Yes        |
| 7B    | A100     | 0.138s              | 14.07 GB     | $0.0001250       | Yes        |
| 13B   | T4       | 0.688s              | 26.09 GB     | $0.0001040       | **No**     |
| 13B   | A100     | 0.183s              | 26.09 GB     | $0.0001660       | Yes        |

### Recommendation: **7B Model on T4 GPU**

For batch processing where cost is the top priority, the **7B on T4** is the undisputed winner. It offers the lowest cost per request by a significant margin. The large batch size fully utilizes the hardware, leading to excellent cost-efficiency. The per-request latency of ~0.37s is irrelevant for an offline task, and the overall time to process the batch (3.33s) is very reasonable. The A100 options are much faster but are not nearly as cost-effective, making the T4 the ideal choice for maximizing throughput on a budget.
