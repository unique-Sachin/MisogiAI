# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Product Name:** AI Prompt Optimizer for Coding Tools  
**Date:** June 29, 2025  
**Owner:** Sachin Mishra  
**Version:** 1.0

---

## 1. Objective

Build a tool that optimizes prompts for specific AI coding tools. The goal is to enhance prompt effectiveness and compatibility based on the unique capabilities and expectations of each tool.

---

## 2. Scope & Features

The tool must:

- Accept a base prompt and target AI coding tool selection (e.g., Copilot, Cursor, Replit).
- Analyze the prompt for intent, complexity, and technical requirements.
- Generate an optimized prompt based on the chosen tool’s capabilities.
- Display both the original and optimized prompts with side-by-side comparison.
- Explain the rationale behind the optimization.

---

## 3. Requirements

- Support for 6+ tools (e.g., Copilot, Cursor, Replit, CodeWhisperer, etc.).
- Tool-specific optimization strategies must be implemented as separate modules.
- Web-based user interface for prompt input and output visualization.
- Clear explanation for each optimization performed.

---

## 4. Deliverables

- `app.py` – Main application file (web interface, routing logic).
- `optimizers/` – Folder with individual modules for each tool (e.g., copilot.py, replit.py).
- `tool_analysis.json` – Metadata file describing tool capabilities and optimization strategies.
- `readme.md` – Documentation with usage instructions and examples.

## 5. Note

- You should use streamlit for frontend with python.
