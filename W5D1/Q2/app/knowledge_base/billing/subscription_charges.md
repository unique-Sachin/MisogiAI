## Common Billing Issues

### Why was I charged twice?
This can happen for several reasons:
1. **Upgrade during billing cycle** - You may see both the old plan charge and prorated new plan charge
2. **Failed payment retry** - If a payment fails, we retry and you might see multiple attempts
3. **Multiple subscriptions** - Check if you have multiple accounts or subscriptions

### Refund Policy
- **New subscriptions**: Full refund within 30 days
- **Accidental charges**: Contact support within 7 days
- **Cancellations**: No refunds for partial months, but service continues until period ends
